How To Play SKINnerBox
=======================================================================
To buy a organ you must click on the corresponding buy button
next to the organ you are trying to purchase.

Once you own at least one organ of that organ type you can click
on the image of that organ to generate cells based on the number of
cell generated per click times the number of units you own. This is 
denoted by the label under the buy button. 

Once you own 10 units of any organ you will now passively generate 
cells per second starting from the time the tenth unit of that organ was
purchased.

Once 10 units of each organ has been created and you have accumulated 1 million
cells you can create a Human.

There is no "Win Condition" in a skinner box you just do a little better each time.
